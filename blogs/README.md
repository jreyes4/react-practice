## Overview

The purpose of the project is to learn how to use middleware with react-redux to make asynchronous action creators. In this project, I use axios to make calls to the jsonplaceholder api to fill my react page with dummy data for a blog posts site. I use axios with redux-thunk to make an async call that updates the state of my page, forcing the page to re-render.
